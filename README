Simple Geolocalization and Course Transmission Protocol (SGCTP)
===============================================================

Synopsis
--------

The objective of the Simple Geolocalization and Course Transmission
Protocol (SGCTP) is to transmit 2- or 3-dimensional position and motion data
in such a way as to use as little bandwidth as possible, thus making it fit
to aggregate data from roaming clients with limited network connectivity.

It can be used to:
 - transmit data via UDP, with lowest possible bandwidth but lesser reliability
   and security
 - transmit data via TCP, with guaranteed reliability and security
 - store data to file
 - all of it along optional encryption (and inherent password authentication)


Resources
---------

The Simple Geolocalization and Course Transmission Protocol (SGCTP) source
tree contains the following resources:

* A technical description of the protocol (see the PROTOCOL document)

* A reference C/C++ implementation of the protocol:
   - libsgctp.so: dynamic library
   - libsgctp.a:  static library

* Several utilities...
  ... for devices interfacing:
   - gps2sgctp: convert GPSD data to SGCTP data
   - ais2sgctp: convert GPSD (AIS) data to SGCTP data
   - sbs2sgctp: convert SBS-1 data to SGCTP data
   - flarm2sgctp: convert FLARM data to SGCTP data
  ... for network transmission:
   - sgctp2tdp: send SGCTP data via TCP
   - tcp2sgctp: receive SGCTP data via TCP (single client)
   - sgctp2udp: send SGCTP data via UDP
   - udp2sgctp: receive SGCTP data via UDP
  ... for data display or storage
   - sgctp2dsv: decode and display SGCTP data as DSV
   - sgctp2xml: decode and display SGCTP data as XML
   - sgctp2gpx: decode and display SGCTP data as GPX
  ... for data aggregation and polling
   - sgctphub: aggregates and redistributes the data sent by SGCTP agents
   - hub2sgctp: connects to an SGCTP hub and receives SGCTP data
  ... for data filtering
   - sgctpfilter: filter SGCTP data according to specified rules
  ... for developers/administrators
   - sgctperror: explains error codes return by SGCTP utilities/library
